# Advent Of Code 2023 in Elixir
This repository was created to document my journey solving **[Adcent Of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)** in **[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)**.

## Description
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles. For more information  please visit [here](https://adventofcode.com/).
**[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)** is a dynamic, functional programming language running on the **[BEAM](https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-brief-beam-primer/)** (Bogdan Erlang Abstract Machine), also known as Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.
My goal is to explore the language, its abstractions and ways of transformations.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* **[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)**

### Installing
* clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/61-6D-6D-6F/aoc-2023.git
```

### Executing program
* lauch [iex](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html) from project folder:
 ```
iex -S mix
```
* execute every day at once:
```

```
* or execute a specific day:
```
Aoc2023.Day01Part1.run
